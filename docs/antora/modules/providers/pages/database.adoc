= Database Provider

The **Database Provider** is responsible for providing access to a PostgreSQL
database.

== ClowdApp Configuration

To request a database, a `+ClowdApp+` would use the `+database+` stanza, a
partial example of which is shown below.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: cloud.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClowdApp
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  # Other App Config
  database:
    name: inventory
    version: 12

== ClowdEnv Configuration

=== Modes

The **Database Provider** will run in one of the following modes. These are set up
by the ClowdEnvironment. Depending on the environment you are running you may
or may not have access to change this mode. More information on provider
configuration is at the bottom of this page.

==== local

In local mode, the **Database Provider** will provision a single node PostgreSQL
instance for every app that requests a database and place it in the same
namespace as the `+ClowdApp+`. The client will be given credentials for both a
normal user and an admin user.

ClowdEnv Config options available:

- `+pvc+`

==== app-interface

In app-interface mode, the Clowder operator does not create any resources and
simply passes through configuration from a secret to the client config. The
provider will search all secrets in the same namespace looking for a hostname
which is of the form `+<name>-<env>.*********+` where `+name+` is the name
defined in the `+ClowdApp+` `+database+` stanza, and `+env+` is usually one of
either `+stage+` or `+prod+`.

== Generated App Configuration

The Database configuration appears in the cdappconfig.json with the following
structure. As well as the hostname and port, credentials and database name are
presented.

A client helper is available for the RDS CA, used in app-interface mode.

=== JSON structure

[source,json]
----
{
    "database": {
    "name": "dBaseName",
    "username": "username",
    "password": "password",
    "hostname": "hostname",
    "port": 5432,
    "pgPass": "testing",
    "adminUsername": "adminusername",
    "adminPassword": "adminpassword",
    "rdsCa": "ca"
    }
}

=== Client access

For supported languages, the database configuration is access via the following
attribute names.

[%header,cols="1,2"]
|===
|Language
|Attribute Name

| Python
| `+LoadedConfig.database+`
| Go
| `+LoadedConfig.Database+`
| Javascript
| `+LoadedConfig.database+`
| Ruby
| `+LoadedConfig.database+`

=== Client helpers

==== **RDS Ca**

Returns a filename which points to a temporary file containing the
contents of the CA cert.

=== ClowdEnv Configuration

Configuring the **Database Provider** is done by providing the follow JSON
structure to the `+ClowdEnv+` resource. Further details of the options
available can be found in the API reference. A minimal example is shown below
for the `+operator+` mode. Different modes can use different configuration
options, more information can be found in the API reference.

[source,yaml]

apiVersion: cloud.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClowdEnvivonment
metadata:
  name: myenv
spec:
  # Other Env Config
  providers:
  database:
    mode: local
    pvc: false
