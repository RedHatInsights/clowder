== Dev Environment Setup

* Install https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/#install-from-github-release[operator-sdk]
* Install the latest https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl]
* Install https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/[krew]
* Install kuttl:
  ``kubectl krew install kuttl``
* Install https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html#installation[kubebuilder]

** Normally kubebuilder is installed to ``/usr/local/kubebuilder/bin``. You should see the following
  executables in that directory:
    
    ``etcd  kube-apiserver  kubebuilder  kubectl``

    You may want to append this directory to your ``PATH`` in your ``.bashrc``, ``.zshrc``, or similar.

NOTE: If you choose to place the kubebuilder executables in a different path, make sure to
use the ``KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS`` env var when running tests (mentioned in ``Unit Tests`` section below)

* Install https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/kustomize/installation/binaries/[kustomize]
** The install script places a ``kustomize`` binary in whatever directory you ran the above script in. Move this binary to a folder that is on your ``PATH`` or make sure the directory is appended to your ``PATH``

* Install https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/[minikube]. The latest release we have tested with is https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v1.20.0[v1.20.0].

NOTE: If you want/need to use OpenShift, you can install https://github.com/RedHatInsights/clowder/blob/master/docs/crc-guide.md[Code Ready Containers], just be aware that it consumes a much larger amount of resources and our test helper scripts are designed to work with minikube.

We haven't had much success using the docker/podman drivers, and would recommend the https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/kvm2/[kvm2 driver] or https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/virtualbox/[virtualbox driver]

=== **KVM2-specific notes**

* If you don't have virtualization enabled, follow the guide
  on https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/getting-started-with-virtualization/[the minikube docs]

* Note that ``virt-host-validate`` may throw errors related to cgroups on Fedora 33 -- which you can https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/issues/94[ignore]

* If you don't want to enter a root password when minikube needs to modify its VM, add your user to the ``libvirt`` group:

[source,shell]
sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $(whoami)
newgrp libvirt

* You can set minikube to default to kvm2 with: ``minikube config set driver kvm2``

* Move to the ``Testing`` section below to see if you can successfully run unit tests and E2E tests.

== Running

- ``make install`` will deploy the CRDs to the cluster configured in your kubeconfig.
- ``make run`` will build the binary and locally run the binary, connecting the
  manager to the Openshift cluster configured in your kubeconfig.
- ``make deploy`` will try to run the manager in the cluster configured in your
  kubeconfig.  You likely need to push the image to a docker registry that your Kubernetes
  cluster can access.  See `E2E Testing` below.
- ``make genconfig`` (optionally) needs to be run if the specification for the config
  has been altered.

== Testing

=== Unit Testing

The tests rely on the test environment set up by controller-runtime.  This enables the operator to 
get initialized against a control plane just like it would against a real OpenShift cluster.

To run the tests:

``make test``

If kubebuilder is installed somewhere other than ``/usr/local/kubebuilder/bin``, then:
``KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS=/path/to/kubebuilder/bin make test``

If you're just getting started with writing tests in Go, or getting started with Go in general, take
a look at https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/

=== E2E Testing

There are two e2e testing scripts which:

* build your code changes into a docker image (both ``podman`` or ``docker`` supported)
* push the image into a registry
* deploy the operator onto a kubernetes cluster
* run `kuttl`` tests

The scripts are:

* ``e2e-test.sh`` -- pushes images to quay.io, used mainly for this repo's CI/CD jobs or in cases where you have
  access to a remote cluster on which to test the operator.
* ``e2e-test-local.sh`` -- pushes images to a local docker registry, meant for local testing with minikube

You will usually want to run:

[source,shell]
minikube start --addons=registry
/e2e-test-local.sh

=== Podman Notes
If using podman to build the operator's docker image, ensure sub ID's for rootless mode are configured:
Test with:

[source,shell]
podman system migrate
podman unshare cat /proc/self/uid_map

If those commands throw an error, you need to add entries to ``/etc/subuid`` and ``/etc/subgid`` for your user.
The subuid range must not contain your user ID and the subgid range must not contain your group ID. Example:

[source,shell]
----
❯ id -u
112898
❯ id -g
112898

# Use 200000-265535 since 112898 is not found in this range
❯ sudo usermod --add-subuids 200000-265535 --add-subgids 200000-265535 $(whoami)

# Run migrate again:
❯ podman system migrate
❯ podman unshare cat /proc/self/uid_map

== Migrating an App to Clowder

https://github.com/RedHatInsights/clowder/tree/master/docs/migration[Insights App Migration Guide]

== Doc generation

=== Prerequisites

The API docs are generated by using the https://github.com/elastic/crd-ref-docs[crd-ref-docs] tool
by Elastic. You will need to install ``asciidoctor``:

On Fedora use:

``sudo dnf install -y asciidoctor``

For others, see: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/install/


=== Building docs

Build the docs using:

``make api-docs``

Then be sure to add doc changes before committing, e.g.:

``git add docs/api_reference.html``
