https://github.com/RedHatInsights/clowder/tree/master/docs/[Design docs]

== Dev Environment Setup

* Install https://sdk.operatorframework.io/docs/installation/#install-from-github-release[operator-sdk]
* Install the latest https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/[kubectl]
* Install https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/[krew]
* Install kuttl:
  ``kubectl krew install kuttl``
* Install https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html#installation[kubebuilder]

** Normally kubebuilder is installed to ``/usr/local/kubebuilder/bin``. You should see the following
  executables in that directory:
    
    ``etcd  kube-apiserver  kubebuilder  kubectl``

    You may want to append this directory to your ``PATH`` in your ``.bashrc``, ``.zshrc``, or similar.

NOTE: If you choose to place the kubebuilder executables in a different path, make sure to
use the ``KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS`` env var when running tests (mentioned in ``Unit Tests`` section below)

* Install https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/kustomize/installation/binaries/[kustomize]
** The install script places a ``kustomize`` binary in whatever directory you ran the above script in. Move this binary to a folder that is on your ``PATH`` or make sure the directory is appended to your ``PATH``

* Install https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/[minikube]. The latest release we have tested with is https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/tag/v1.20.0[v1.20.0].

NOTE: If you want/need to use OpenShift, you can install https://github.com/RedHatInsights/clowder/blob/master/docs/crc-guide.md[Code Ready Containers], just be aware that it consumes a much larger amount of resources and our test helper scripts are designed to work with minikube.

We haven't had much success using the docker/podman drivers, and would recommend the https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/kvm2/[kvm2 driver] or https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/virtualbox/[virtualbox driver]

=== **KVM2-specific notes**

* If you don't have virtualization enabled, follow the guide
  on https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/getting-started-with-virtualization/[the minikube docs]

* Note that ``virt-host-validate`` may throw errors related to cgroups on Fedora 33 -- which you can https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/issues/94[ignore]

* If you don't want to enter a root password when minikube needs to modify its VM, add your user to the ``libvirt`` group:

[source,shell]
sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $(whoami)
newgrp libvirt

* You can set minikube to default to kvm2 with: ``minikube config set driver kvm2``

* Move to the ``Testing`` section below to see if you can successfully run unit tests and E2E tests.

== Running

- ``make install`` will deploy the CRDs to the cluster configured in your kubeconfig.
- ``make run`` will build the binary and locally run the binary, connecting the
  manager to the Openshift cluster configured in your kubeconfig.
- ``make deploy`` will try to run the manager in the cluster configured in your
  kubeconfig.  You likely need to push the image to a docker registry that your Kubernetes
  cluster can access.  See `E2E Testing` below.
- ``make genconfig`` (optionally) needs to be run if the specification for the config
  has been altered.

== Testing

=== Unit Testing

The tests rely on the test environment set up by controller-runtime.  This enables the operator to 
get initialized against a control plane just like it would against a real OpenShift cluster.

To run the tests:

``make test``

If kubebuilder is installed somewhere other than ``/usr/local/kubebuilder/bin``, then:
``KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS=/path/to/kubebuilder/bin make test``

If you're just getting started with writing tests in Go, or getting started with Go in general, take
a look at https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/

=== E2E Testing

There are two e2e testing scripts which:

* build your code changes into a docker image (both ``podman`` or ``docker`` supported)
* push the image into a registry
* deploy the operator onto a kubernetes cluster
* run `kuttl`` tests

The scripts are:

* ``e2e-test.sh`` -- pushes images to quay.io, used mainly for this repo's CI/CD jobs or in cases where you have
  access to a remote cluster on which to test the operator.
* ``e2e-test-local.sh`` -- pushes images to a local docker registry, meant for local testing with minikube

You will usually want to run:

[source,shell]
minikube start --addons=registry
/e2e-test-local.sh

=== Podman Notes
If using podman to build the operator's docker image, ensure sub ID's for rootless mode are configured:
Test with:

[source,shell]
podman system migrate
podman unshare cat /proc/self/uid_map

If those commands throw an error, you need to add entries to ``/etc/subuid`` and ``/etc/subgid`` for your user.
The subuid range must not contain your user ID and the subgid range must not contain your group ID. Example:

[source,shell]
----
❯ id -u
112898
❯ id -g
112898

# Use 200000-265535 since 112898 is not found in this range
❯ sudo usermod --add-subuids 200000-265535 --add-subgids 200000-265535 $(whoami)

# Run migrate again:
❯ podman system migrate
❯ podman unshare cat /proc/self/uid_map

== Migrating an App to Clowder

https://github.com/RedHatInsights/clowder/tree/master/docs/migration[Insights App Migration Guide]

== Doc generation

=== Prerequisites

The API docs are generated by using the https://github.com/elastic/crd-ref-docs[crd-ref-docs] tool
by Elastic. You will need to install ``asciidoctor``:

On Fedora use:

``sudo dnf install -y asciidoctor``

For others, see: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/install/


=== Generating docs

Generating the docs source using:

``make api-docs``

Then be sure to add doc changes before committing, e.g.:

``git add docs/antora/modules/ROOT/pages/api_reference.adoc``

=== Previewing Docs

The build docs stage only generates the asciidoc files. To actually view them, it is required to 
install antora.

``npm install @antora/cli@2.3 @antora/site-generator-default@2.3``

A ``playbook.yaml`` is required at the root of the repo which refers to certain directories:

[source,yaml]
----
site:
  title: Clowder Documentation
  url: https://redhatinsights.github.io/clowder/
  start_page: clowder::index.adoc
content:
  sources:
  - url: /path/to/clowder/
    branches: master
    start_path: docs/antora
ui:
  bundle:
    url: https://gitlab.com/antora/antora-ui-default/-/jobs/artifacts/master/raw/build/ui-bundle.zip?job=bundle-stable
    snapshot: true
  output_dir: ui
runtime:
  fetch: true
output:
  dir: docs
----

After this, the antora build can be invoked:

``./node_modules/.bin/antora generate playbook.yaml``

And then viewed from the ``docs/clowder/dev/index.html`` entrypoint.

== Clowder configuration

Clowder can read a configuration file in order to turn on certain debug options, toggle feature
flags and perform profiling. By default clowder will read from the file
``/config/clowder_config.json`` to configure itself. When deployed as a pod, it an optional volume
is configured to look for a ``ConfigMap`` in the same namespace, called ``clowder-config`` which
looks similar to the following.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  clowder_config.json: |-
    {
        "debugOptions": {
            "trigger": {
                "diff": false
            },
            "cache": {
                "create": false,
                "update": false,
                "apply": false
            },
            "pprof": {
                "enable": true,
                "cpuFile": "testcpu"
            }
        },
        "features": {
            "createServiceMonitor": false,
            "watchStrimziResources": true
        } 
    }
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: clowder-config
----

To run clowder with the ``make run`` (or to debug it VSCode), and apply configuration, it is
required to either create the ``/config/clowder_config.json`` file in the filesystem of the machine
running the Clowder process, or to use the environment variable ``CLOWDER_CONFIG_PATH`` to point to
an alternative file.

At startup, Clowder will print the configuration that was read in the logs

[source,text]
[2021-06-16 11:10:44] INFO   Loaded config config:{'debugOptions': {'trigger': {'diff': True}, 'cache': {'create': True, 'update': True, 'apply': True}, 'pprof': {'enable': True, 'cpuFile': 'testcpu'}}, 'features': {'createServiceMonitor': False, 'disableWebhooks': True, 'watchStrimziResources': False, 'useComplexStrimziTopicNames': False}}

=== Debug flags

Clowder has several debug flags which can aid in troubleshooting difficult situations. These are 
defined in the below.

* ``debugOptions.trigger.diff`` - When a resource is responsible for triggering a reconciliation of
  either a ``ClowdApp`` or a ``ClowdEnvironment`` this option will print out a diff of the old and 
  new resource, allowing an inspection of what actually triggered the reconciliation.

=== FeatureFlags
Clowder currently support several feature flags which are intended to enable or disable certain 
behaviour. They are detailed as follows:

[options="header"]
|===============
| Flag Name | Description | Permanent
| ``features.createServiceMonitor`` | Enables the creation of prometheus ``ServiceMonitor`` 
resources. | No
| ``features.disableWebhooks`` | While testing locally and for the ``suite_test``, the webhooks need
to be disabled. this option facilitates that. | Yes
| ``features.watchStrimziResources`` | When enabled, Clowder will assume ownership of the ``Kafka`` 
and ``KafkaConnect`` resources it creates. It will then respond to changes to these resources. | No
| ``features.useComplexStrimziTopicNames`` | This flag switches Clowder to use non-colliding names
for strimzi resources. This is important if using a singular strimzi server for multiple 
``ClowdEnvironment`` resources. | Yes
|===============
