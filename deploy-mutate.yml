                                        An existing PVC with that name that is not
                                        owned by the pod

                                        will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using
                                        an unrelated

                                        volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then
                                        blocked until

                                        the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created
                                        PVC is

                                        meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to
                                        updated with an

                                        owner reference to the pod once the pod exists.

                                        by the host operating system.

                                        Examples: "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly
                                        inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.

                                    The volume is resolved at pod startup depending
                                    on which PullPolicy value is provided:


                                    - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull

                                    the pull fails.

                                    creation will fail if the reference isn''t present.

                                    - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference
                                    isn''t already present on disk. Container creation
                                    will fail if the reference isn''t present and

                                    The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted
                                    and recreated, which means that new remote content
                                    will become available on pod recreation.

                                    A failure to resolve or pull the image during
                                    pod startup will block containers from starting

                                    be retried using normal volume backoff and will
                                    be reported on the pod reason and message.

                                    The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory

                                    The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and
                                    non-executable files (noexec).

                                              the signer approves the

                                              Kubelet writes the key and

                                              certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The

                                              Kubelet will begin trying to rotate

                                              Kubelet can write a single file, indicated

                                              The credential bundle is a single file
                                              in PEM format.  The first PEM

                                              entry is the private key (in PKCS#8
                                              format), and the remaining PEM

                                              entries are the certificate chain issued
                                              by the signer (typically,

                                              signers will return their certificate
                                              chain in leaf-to-root order).


                                              Prefer using the credential bundle format,
                                              since your application code

                                              can read it atomically.  If you use
                                              keyPath and certificateChainPath,

                                              your application must make two separate
                                              file reads. If these coincide

                                              with a certificate rotation, it is possible
                                              that the private key and leaf

                                              certificate you read may not correspond
                                              to each other.  Your application

                                              will need to check for this condition,
                                              and re-read until they are

                                              consistent.


                                              The named signer controls chooses the

                                                  because it is possible to read the

                                                  files mid-rotation.'

                                                  The credential bundle is a single
                                                  file that contains multiple PEM
                                                  blocks.

                                                  The first PEM block is a PRIVATE
                                                  KEY block, containing a PKCS#8 private

                                                  key.


                                                  The remaining blocks are CERTIFICATE
                                                  blocks, containing the issued

                                                  certificate chain from the signer
                                                  (leaf and any intermediates).


                                                  Using credentialBundlePath lets
                                                  your Pod''s application code make
                                                  a single

                                                  project them to separate files,
                                                  your application code will need

                                                  additionally check that the leaf
                                                  certificate was issued to the key.'

                                                  will reject values shorter than

                                                  The signer implementation is then
                                                  free to issue a certificate with

                                    The volume is resolved at pod startup depending
                                    on which PullPolicy value is provided:


                                    - Always: the kubelet always attempts to pull
                                    the reference. Container creation will fail If
                                    the pull fails.

                                    - Never: the kubelet never pulls the reference
                                    and only uses a local image or artifact. Container
                                    creation will fail if the reference isn''t present.

                                    - IfNotPresent: the kubelet pulls if the reference
                                    isn''t already present on disk. Container creation
                                    will fail if the reference isn''t present and
                                    the pull fails.


                                    The volume gets re-resolved if the pod gets deleted
                                    and recreated, which means that new remote content
                                    will become available on pod recreation.

                                    A failure to resolve or pull the image during
                                    pod startup will block containers from starting
                                    and may add significant latency. Failures will
                                    be retried using normal volume backoff and will
                                    be reported on the pod reason and message.

                                    The types of objects that may be mounted by this
                                    volume are defined by the container runtime implementation
                                    on a host machine and at minimum must include
                                    all valid types supported by the container image

                                    The OCI object gets mounted in a single directory
                                    (spec.containers[*].volumeMounts.mountPath) by

                                    for container images.

                                    The volume will be mounted read-only (ro) and
                                    non-executable files (noexec).

                                              Kubelet generates a private key and
                                              uses it to send a

                                              PodCertificateRequest to the named signer.  Once
                                              the signer approves the

                                              request and issues a certificate chain,
                                              Kubelet writes the key and

                                              certificate chain to the pod filesystem.  The

                                              Kubelet will begin trying to rotate

                                              Kubelet can write a single file, indicated

                                              field, or separate files, indicated

                                              The credential bundle is a single file
                                              in PEM format.  The first PEM

                                              entry is the private key (in PKCS#8
                                              format), and the remaining PEM

                                              entries are the certificate chain issued
                                              by the signer (typically,

                                              signers will return their certificate
                                              chain in leaf-to-root order).


                                              Prefer using the credential bundle format,
                                              since your application code

                                              can read it atomically.  If you use
                                              keyPath and certificateChainPath,

                                              your application must make two separate
                                              file reads. If these coincide

                                              with a certificate rotation, it is possible
                                              that the private key and leaf

                                              certificate you read may not correspond
                                              to each other.  Your application

                                              will need to check for this condition,
                                              and re-read until they are

                                              consistent.


                                              The named signer controls chooses the

                                                  because it is possible to read the

                                                  files mid-rotation.'
